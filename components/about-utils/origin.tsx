          Inspiration Behind Richie.js
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-3 text-justify">
          As the founder of a software agency, full-stack engineer, and SEO
          specialist, I've always looked for methods to streamline workflows and
          reduce tiresome, repeated activities. Richie.js was inspired by a
          simple yet powerful realization: every rich result comprises the same
          information that already exists on the webpage.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-3 text-justify font-semibold">
          Why couldnâ€™t we automate this process?
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-3 text-justify">
          With this idea in mind, I set out to build a tool that could
          aggregate, and serialize existing page data into JSON-LD format before
          flawlessly adding it to the page. The goal was to simplify the process
          of producing rich results, saving time and effort for both developers
          and marketers.

              <span className="font-medium">Version 2.0.1:</span> Richie.js
              evolved to allow for client-side implementation, making it
              compatible with newer frameworks such as Next.js, AngularJS,
              Vue.js, and React.js. This enables users to easily automate the
              generation of rich results using reserved class names.
