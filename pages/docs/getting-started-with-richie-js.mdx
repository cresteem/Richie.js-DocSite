# Getting Started

## How Richie.js Works

Richie.js simplifies the process of generating structured data for rich results, improving your website's search engine visibility and user engagement. Here's how it works:

<Steps>
### Step 1: Choose Your Environment
Richie.js can be used in two main ways:
- **Browser-Side (Dynamic)**: Dynamically generates structured data directly in the browser at runtime.
- **Node.js (Pre-Generated)**: Generates structured data ahead of time, which can be embedded into static webpages.

### Step 2: Integrate Richie.js

- For **browser-side use**, include the Richie.js script and call its API to dynamically generate structured data.
- For **Node.js**, install Richie.js and use its CLI or API to pre-generate JSON-LD for your static or pre-rendered pages.

### Step 3: Automate Rich Results

Once integrated, Richie.js automatically identifies the desired elements on your webpage and generates structured data for the specified rich result types. This ensures your website is SEO-ready without manual coding efforts.

<Table id="env">

      <Th>Environment</Th>
      <Th>Best For</Th>
    </Tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <Tr>
      <Td>Browser-Side</Td>
      <Td>Client-side rendering, or dynamic data-driven sites.</Td>
    </Tr>
    <Tr>
      <Td>Node.js</Td>
      <Td>Generating structured data for static pages or pre-rendered HTML.</Td>
    </Tr>
