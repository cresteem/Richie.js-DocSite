# Sitelinks search box (WebSite)

## What is sitelinks search box?
A sitelinks search box allows users to search your site or app directly from the search results page, offering real-time suggestions and other features.

Google Search might automatically display a search box specific to your website when it appears as a search result, without any additional effort on your part. This search box is powered by Google Search. However, you can enhance its functionality by adding WebSite structured data, which helps Google better understand your site.

If Google Search has already provided a sitelink search box for your site, you can manage certain aspects of it by adding WebSite structured data.

Kindly Refer [Google Doc](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/sitelinks-searchbox) to know more about sitelinks search box rich result.
