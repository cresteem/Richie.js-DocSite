  Richie.js works with static HTML content that is loaded when the page is rendered.
  For dynamically loaded content (e.g., JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js),

  JS is executed. You may need to trigger Richie.js after dynamic content is loaded
  or use server-side rendering (SSR) to ensure proper integration.
