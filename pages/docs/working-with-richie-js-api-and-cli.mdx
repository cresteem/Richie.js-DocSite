# **Working with API and CLI**

Richie.js provides two powerful tools for integrating structured data and rich results into your web projects: the **API** and the **CLI** (Command Line Interface). Depending on your development environment and needs, you can choose to work with the API for dynamic, programmatic integration, or use the CLI for batch generation and configuration management.

This page serves as an overview and a guide to help you get started with both tools. For more detailed information on each, use the buttons below to access the child pages for **API** and **CLI**.

#### **Choose Your Way**

- **API**: The API allows you to generate rich snippets programmatically from both Node.js and browser-side environments. It is perfect for integration into dynamic web applications.
