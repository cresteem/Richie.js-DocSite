# Node.js Setup

## How Richie.js Works in Node.js?

Richie.js allows you to generate **JSON-LD structured data** from **pre-rendered HTML files**. This is useful for SEO purposes, helping search engines better understand your content. Richie.js works seamlessly in **Node.js** using either the **API** or **CLI** method.

### Step 1: Install Richie.js Package

To get started, install Richie.js in your **Node.js** project using **npm** or **yarn**.

Run the following command in your project’s root directory:

```bash
npm install @cresteem/richie-js
```

or

```bash
yarn add @cresteem/richie-js
```

This installs the Richie.js package and its dependencies so that you can begin using it for generating structured data.

### Step 2: Use Reserved Class Names in HTML Elements

Richie.js works by identifying specific **reserved class names** within your HTML elements. These class names help Richie.js scrape the necessary data to generate JSON-LD output for various rich result types. In this example, we’ll use the **FAQ** rich result type.

Here's an example of how your HTML should look when using Richie.js for **FAQ** structured data:

```html
<body>
  <!-- rjs reserved name - faq reserved name - id(unique number) - reserved wrapper name -->
  <details class="rjs-faq">
    <summary class="question">
      Can you provide a content management system (CMS) that allows me to update
      the website easily?
    </summary>

    <p class="answer">
      <b
        >Certainly! We take pride in crafting custom Content Management Systems
        (CMS) tailored exclusively to your requirements.</b
      >
      Unlike common pre-made template CMS, our solutions are designed with your
      unique needs in mind. With Cresteem, managing your website's content is
      not only simple but also seamlessly integrated for a truly
      <b>personalized experience.</b>
    </p>
  </details>
</body>
```

In this example:

- The class `rjs-faq` is used to identify the FAQ element.
- The class `question` is used for the FAQ question.
- The class `answer` is used for the FAQ answer.

Richie.js will scan these reserved class names in the HTML, extract the necessary content, and generate the corresponding **JSON-LD** data for the **FAQ** rich result type.

Each **rich result type** (e.g., `Article`, `Product`, `FAQ`) has its own set of reserved class names that are required for Richie.js to generate the correct structured data, refer [Supported Rich Results](/docs/exploring-rich-results-with-richie-js).

### Step 3: Call Richie.js API or CLI Method

Once you’ve installed Richie.js and set up your HTML with the required class names, you can use either the **API** or the **CLI** method to generate the structured data.

#### Method 1: Using Richie.js API

You can learn more about using the **Richie.js API** on the [API Setup Page](/docs/working-with-richie-js-api-and-cli/api).

Here’s an example of how to use Richie.js with the API to generate structured data:

```javascript
const { richie } = require("@cresteem/richie-js");

const type = "faq"; // Set your desired rich result type
const inputFile = "pages/faq-page.html"; // Your pre-rendered HTML file
const outputFile = "./output.html";

// Generate structured data (JSON-LD)
richie([type], inputFile, outputFile);
```

This will process the HTML file specified in `inputFile`, scrape the relevant information based on the class names, and generate the corresponding JSON-LD output in the `outputFile` location.

#### Method 2: Using Richie.js CLI

You can learn more about using the **Richie.js CLI** on the [CLI Setup Page](/docs/working-with-richie-js-api-and-cli/cli).

If you prefer using the **CLI**, Richie.js offers a simple command for batch processing:

use the following command to generate structured data for your pre-rendered HTML files:

```bash
rjs make
```

or

```bash
npx rjs make
```

This command will look for the HTML files in your project and automatically generate the appropriate JSON-LD data based on the defined class names for each file.

### Summary

In just three easy steps, you can use Richie.js to generate SEO-friendly structured data for your static HTML pages:

1. **Install the Richie.js package** in your Node.js project.
2. **Apply the required reserved class names** to your HTML elements.
3. **Call Richie.js via API or CLI** to generate the corresponding JSON-LD structured data.

For more detailed instructions on using the **API** or **CLI**, please refer to their respective pages in the documentation:

- [Richie.js CLI Setup](/docs/working-with-richie-js-api-and-cli/cli)
